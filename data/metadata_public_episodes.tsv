Bill Oddie, cameraman John Aitchison and sound recorder Chris Watson reveal the hidden lives of Britain's animals.  Bill takes cameraman John to a landfill site and sets him the challenge of finding and filming wildlife there. But if Bill thinks this is a barren waste land devoid of life, then he's truly mistaken. John has some remarkable encounters with specialised opportunists that don't seem at all perturbed by the 50 tonne trucks cruising past or the thousands of tonnes of rubbish being dumped.   Next Bill's off to the Norfolk Broads where he finds an animal that seems to have all the attributes of a cross between a bear, a sheep and an elephant. This creature is so rare in its native country that scientists now have to travel to the UK to study it.  Sound recordist, Chris Watson, joins Bill on the beach as Chris demonstrates that a few hydrophones are as handy as a bucket and spade for a trip to the sea side. Rock pools that teem with life are wired for sound and the duo get to listen in to snapping shrimp, scuttling crabs and squelching anemones.  Are those UFOs swarming over Oxford? Previously mistaken as unidentified flying objects, they're actually swifts. Astonishingly swifts do almost everything on the wing, including sleep. The one thing that brings them down to earth is the urge to nest. Bill goes up a tower in Oxford for his first close encounter with swifts.  And finally Bill has some dubious guests visiting his back garden - rats. He's happy with their comings and goings, but the missus is not so keen. After pressure from his family and a spate of petty rat vandalism, he endeavours to get rid of them humanely. In the process he makes some headway into rat research.

Bill sets cameraman John a mission to film elusive bird of prey the Goshawk. To make John's task really tough it has chosen to hang out on the fringes of a military base. Will John succeed with such limited access to his subject?   Back on his home turf, Bill is overjoyed to witness the arrival of a wren family into his back garden. But his happiness is short-lived as things take a turn for the worse and suddenly there is a murder mystery to solve. Bill laments the victims and attempts to locate the perpetrator.  On a lighter note, Bill turns his musical talents to those of our British song birds. His theory is that by categorising their song into jazz or classical genres it is easier to identify which birds are singing which tune.   And if you thought these musings were purely fanciful then there are more surprises as Bill ponders communication with the natural world further - by talking to the trees. He teams up with Chris Watson to listen in to the sounds of a grand old oak. Over the passage of time this ancient old tree has witnessed civil wars, agricultural and industrial revolutions. But in its lifetime generations of the local wildlife have been consistent visitors. Chris places microphones high up in the canopy and deep into the heart of this old tree so that he and Bill can listen in to the hidden sounds that exist within.  Away from the countryside and deep within the heart of London, Bill meets Artist Tony Heywood who has always been curious about microscopic life forms and has taken his enthusiasm for the minutiae to new levels with his work Shimmer.

Bill joins cameraman John on a river in Scotland and tests his patience with a challenge to film a family of dippers. This multi-talented bird soon appears from the dark peaty waters and provides John with a whole load of entertainment.  It's also judgement day for a load of rooks. Not only are these birds intent on making a racket but their raucous behaviour leads Bill to draw similarities between them and politicians. He explores some of the folklore surrounding these birds and with a bit of role play brings order to chaos.  Up in a woodland wilderness, Bill explores plans to reintroduce beavers to the British countryside. These giant rodents look cute and cuddly but are still viewed by some as interfering tree-fellers with no place in our countryside. Bill spends some time tracking them down and finds out that beavers can in fact have a positive effect on the landscape.  Elsewhere the sun is shining down on sound recordist Chris as he kicks back in a summertime meadow. Bill joins him to examine life in the undergrowth and together they get a buzz out of the many creatures living there. With Chris's audio wizardry they manage to seek out some mini-beasts together but it is only when somebody truly puts their foot in it that they unearth the amazing sounds of a magical underground home.  And finally we venture back into Bill's garden to take a look at the nocturnal guests. It's the fly by night visitors that Bill is interested in, so he sets a trap to entice these beauties down from above.

Next up, Bill sets John his most difficult challenge yet, to film dragonflies in flight. He has his work cut out for him. Dragonflies can fly at 30 mph and can change direction in a fraction of a second, making them almost impossible to follow with a telephoto lens.  Meanwhile, Bill enters into a light-hearted investigation of herbal plants. Their use is often thought of as new age, but it's actually very old age. In the seventeenth century a philosophy called The Doctrine of Signatures declared that a plant was able to heal the part of the body that it resembled. Many doctors of the day followed this principle. So were they right? Bill reveals all.  And finally, Bill takes a look at the highlights of the series.

The remarkable idea that our universe simply began from nothing has not always been accepted with the conviction it is today and, from fiercely disputed leftfield beginnings, took the best part of the 20th century to emerge as the triumphant explanation of how the universe began. Using curious horn-shaped antennas, U-2 spy planes, satellites and particle accelerators, scientists have slowly pieced together the cosmological jigsaw, and this documentary charts the overwhelming evidence for a universe created by a Big Bang.

Series about early European explorations of Earth's wildernesses looks at the Canadian Arctic, a place of sublime beauty where expeditions often disappeared without trace.	Two hundred years ago, the Arctic was largely a great blank on the map for would-be explorers. It captured their imagination as a place of sublime beauty and yet also as a desolate frozen landscape, home to the deadly polar bear. It was a place where heroes attempted to find the North-West passage and where whole expeditions disappeared without trace.   In the last century, the polar sea has become a region of vital strategic significance where the great powers built secret bases, transforming the lifestyle of the Inuit. Now, as the Arctic ice melts, the polar bear has become an emblem for the fragility of our planet.

Documentary that tells the surprising story of how Britain entered a new age of steam railways after the Second World War and why it quickly came to an end.	The surprising story of how Britain entered a new age of steam railways after the Second World War and why it quickly came to an end.   After the war, the largely destroyed railways of Europe were rebuilt to carry more modern diesel and electric trains. Britain, however, chose to build thousands of brand new steam locomotives. Did we stay with steam because coal was seen as the most reliable power source or were the railways run by men who couldn't bear to let go of their beloved steam trains?   The new British locomotives were designed to stay in service well into the 1970s, but in some cases they were taken off the railways and scrapped within just five years. When Dr Richard Beeching took over British Railways in the 1960s the writing was on the wall, and in 1968 the last steam passenger train blew its whistle.   But while steam use declined, steam enthusiasm grew. As many steam engines lay rusting in scrapyards around Britain, enthusiasts raised funds to buy, restore and return them to their former glory. In 2008, the first brand new steam locomotive to be built in Britain in nearly 50 years rolled off the line, proving our enduring love of these machines.

Nick Knowles gives urban spaces a reverse makeover. The team meets Betty from Crayford, who cannot understand why she doesn't sees butterflies any more.	The series kicks off in a small back garden in Crayford, Kent. It is the kind of garden that many of us have: a manicured lawn with narrow borders around the edges. It is home to Betty, a lovely lady who cannot understand why she never sees butterflies these days. She has put up bird feeders, but is not attracting any of our feathered friends. In fact, she misses wildlife so much that she has gathered a menagerie of plastic animals to fill the gap.   Cue BBC1's man of action Nick Knowles, award-winning garden designer Chris Beardshaw and wildlife buff Ellie Harrison. The Wild About Your Garden crew are on a mission to attract the real thing into Betty's garden. It is the ultimate reverse make over, as the garden has to go backwards before it can go forwards.

And while they are there, Ellie realises the team can help save Britain's most endangered mammal, the water vole. Betty might need some convincing, though, as she thinks they look like rats!

Undeterred, Nick tries to convince the locals to plant trees in every garden to create a red squirrel runway, straight from the local woods into the family's garden.

In the fourth programme of this new series the Wild About Your Garden team face a rather prickly problem in Birmingham.

Cork producer and wildlife enthusiast Francisco Garrett explains what will be lost if cork stoppers are replaced by plastic or screwtops.	Wildlife film. Every time we weigh up which bottle of wine to buy, we hold the fate of nightingales, rare black storks, secretive wild cats and one of the world's most remarkable trees in our hands. It has all to do with the stopper. If it is cork, it probably came from the bark of one of the ancient cork oak trees from the Montados, in the Alentejo region of Portugal.   The cork oak is the only tree in the world whose bark can be periodically removed without killing it. But this tree is amazing in other ways. It survives in poor soil and searing heat, and provides not only nesting places for booted eagles but also space for some of Europe's rarest wildflowers. This exquisitely filmed portrait of the Montados reveals one of the last places in Europe where a sustainable local economy still dovetails harmoniously with nature.   Cork producer and wildlife enthusiast Francisco Garrett explains what will be lost if cork stoppers are replaced by plastic or screwtops.

When two young boys are kidnapped by extremists, it falls to Detective Superintendent Iain Barclay and his inexperienced team to rescue them.	Two-part police thriller, written by Mick Ford and starring Hugh Bonneville and Janet McTeer in a reprisal of their Five Days characters, Detective Superintendent Barclay and Detective Sergeant Amy Foster.   When extremists kidnap two seven year-old boys from very different backgrounds and promise to release them only if their radical demands are met, the case falls into the hands of the intuitive and pragmatic Iain Barclay.   Faced with a relatively inexperienced and increasingly unreliable team, Barclay soon calls his firm friend and faithful deputy Amy Foster out of early retirement and away from the bottle to support him in solving what emerges to be a highly sensitive crime.

A team of fashion writers and commentators including Peter York, Colin McDowell, Ted Polhemus and Hilary Alexander looks at the relationship between British fashion and the BBC.	Documentary which takes a provocative and entertaining journey through the BBC's own fashion collection.  For 50 years the BBC has often treated fashion as a frivolous, decadent diversion from the serious matters of life, but now a 'style council' of fashion writers and commentators including Peter York, Colin McDowell, Ted Polhemus and Hilary Alexander turns the tables and lets British fashion take on the BBC.  In the 1950s we find programmes debating whether men should decide what women wear. In the 1960s we see Alan Whicker unleashed upon the 'silly, superficial world' of French couture, while the big story of Mary Quant is almost ignored back home. In the 1970s comes the revulsion against punk style, and it is not until the 1980s that TV treats fashion with any kind of appreciation with The Clothes Show, generally held as the BBC's finest hour in the world of dressing up.  The programmes concludes that British fashion is unique in that it is driven more by youth culture than by fashion houses. Through the stories of the models, the designers, the photographers and the clothes themselves, it shows how the establishment has come to terms with the transformation of post-war Britain.

5313988659941518150	Darwin's Dangerous Idea	21/09/2018	60	factual/scienceandnature	documentaries	Andrew Marr explores how Darwin's theory of evolution has taken on a life of its own.	Andrew Marr explores how Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has taken on a life of its own far beyond the world of science.	In the first episode of the three-part series, Andrew Marr explores how Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has taken on a life of its own far beyond the world of science.   He argues that Darwin's theory has transformed our understanding of what it means to be human. Over the last 150 years, Darwin's ideas have challenged the need for a creator, undermined religious authority and provided new ways of looking at the origins of human morality.   Marr's journey begins following Darwin's footsteps in Tierra del Fuego at the southernmost tip of South America, where Darwin first encountered a native tribe. This began to raise questions in his mind about the origins of the human race. The answers to these questions would emerge over the next 30 years, culminating in the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859.   Marr then traces the development of Darwin's idea as it spread around the world and finds a range of influences that Darwin could never have imagined: from the existential philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche to the battlefields of the First World War; from the Freudian psychoanalyst's couch to the Vatican; from the genetic logic of kindness to an Islamic creationist's claim that Darwin is to blame for modern terrorism. Darwin's dangerous idea is as influential and challenging today as it was 150 years ago.

Andrew Marr discovers how Darwin's ideas are helping mankind to save life on earth from extinction. He explains Darwin's theory and shows our own destructive powers.	In the final episode of this groundbreaking series about Charles Darwin's legacy, Andrew Marr discovers how Darwin's ideas are helping us to save ourselves and all life on earth from extinction. Marr argues that Charles Darwin is the father of ecology. The modern environmental movement was built upon his insight that all life on earth is linked by a delicate web of connections. He also discovers that Darwin's dangerous idea is inspiring scientists to create a 'flotilla of Darwinian Noah's Arks' to help save life on earth from disaster.  Exploring the impact of industrialisation, intensive farming and our growing hunger for meat, Marr tells the story of our slow awakening to the full implications of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and our own destructive powers as a species. After showing how Darwin developed his ideas by digging up fossils, exploring coral reefs and studying the habits of the humble earthworm, Marr explains how Darwin's dangerous idea was launched into the space age. He discovers the mysterious movements of the 'mouse society', snorkels over a coral reef and visits a 'boiling cauldron of evolution' - the tropical rainforest - which is now threatened by the shadow of mass extinction.   Over the last 150 years, the combination of Darwin's ideas with politics has often had disastrous social consequences. In this programme, Andrew Marr argues that our failure to combine politics with Darwin's insights into the delicate connections between all life on earth could be accelerating the countdown to our own extinction.

Travel in time from the heady glamour of Britain's first terminal at Croydon to the signs and squiggles that direct pilots, as well as passengers, in today's airports. This series reveals how rivalry, skulduggery and sheer passion for flight gave birth to our airports, turning muddy airfields into the 24-hour mini-cities we know today.

Series telling the story of North Sea oil and gas. This edition gives a voice to the men who made the discovery in the 1960s and who risked their lives to get the oil ashore.	Three-part series combining archive footage and eye-witness accounts to tell the dramatic narrative of North Sea oil and gas from the 1960s to the present. It charts the decades when the country made the most of its North Sea windfall, with scarcely a thought about where it came from or of the men and women who brought it to us. Through the story of oil, the series offers a fresh perspective on British politics and society and a timely insight into the state of our economy today.  Forty years ago, Britain was poised on the brink of an extraordinary discovery - oil, billions of gallons of it, deep beneath the harsh waters of the North Sea. This opening edition gives a voice to some of the men who made that discovery and who risked their lives in the North Sea to get the oil ashore.   Theirs is a tale of dramatic risk-taking and high politics as the government and the oil companies raced to get their hands on the bonanza. The promise of enormous riches inspired technical innovation on a scale never seen before, but did the haste of the North Sea project put at risk the lives of men who were working in some of the most extreme conditions in the world?

Sophie Raworth and Justin Rowlatt ask why, several decades after the Equal Pay Act, there is still a pay gap between men and women.	In the second of two provocative programmes, we look at pay, asking why there is still a pay gap several decades after the Equal Pay Act. Presenters Sophie Raworth and Justin Rowlatt want to find out why the average pay gap is 17 per cent. And it is not just professional curiosity; as parents of girls, the pair really want to know.  On their journey Sophie and Justin meet professionals, mums and academics, and do some of their own tests, asking whether it is just sexism at play or if there are more complex reasons. Could it be that women are actually choosing to earn less? And they find some shocking facts: in the US thin women earn more than fat women; girls who go to single-sex schools go on to earn more; and hundreds of thousands of women in the UK are illegally being paid less than their male counterparts.  The programme also features specially commissioned surveys that throw new light on the debate. There are plenty of arguments along the way, but Sophie and Justin do manage to reach a conclusion.

Through the story of oil, the series offers a fresh perspective on British politics and society and a timely insight into the state of our economy today.  As the oil industry boomed in the early 1980s, workers up and down the country vied for jobs offshore. Under Margaret Thatcher, dozens of new platforms were built in the North Sea, bringing in millions of barrels of oil and billions of pounds of taxes to the Treasury. The economy was transformed as the fortunes of oil and banking soared, while Britain's traditional manufacturing industries declined.   But before the decade was out the boom would turn to bust with the collapse of the global price of oil, and the industry would be rocked a succession of tragedies, culminating in the destruction of the Piper Alpha platform by fire and the deaths of 167 men.

The first Gulf War of 1991 brought home the fragility of global supplies of energy. Suddenly our North Sea oil and gas were more important than ever, but there were problems looming on the horizon. As oil reserves were used up, oil companies were about to face their biggest challenge yet.    Getting rid of redundant platforms brought them into a dramatic confrontation with an environmental movement that was growing in confidence and influence. As the flow of oil began to slow down, the oil men and women had to venture into ever deeper waters in the search for new supplies. Their quest would inspire a new generation of awe-inspiring underwater technology.   With North Sea oil and gas still supplying most of Britain's energy, it may be that the extraordinary national adventure, which began 40 years ago in the North Sea, is far from over.

Could it be that Hunt prefers the idea of Annie the whore to that of Annie the wife? Is Rossetti capable of taking on responsibility and a conventional role in life? Fred watches on as his friends start to panic, but can he hold his own nerve and keep his affair with Annie a secret from his friend 'Maniac' Hunt?

If the Brits are to emerge from the jungle as Jaminawa men they will have to do everything Carlito demands of them.

Presenter Nick Knowles and wildlife film-maker James Honeyborne are joined by underwater expert Tooni Mahto to assess the competitors trying to win a job with the BBC's prestigious Natural History Unit.  First they need to learn the skill of free-diving - holding their breath and swimming into the depths of the ocean while trying to use an unwieldy underwater camera. Luckily Tooni is an expert. All the competitors can swim, but learning this new skill pushes some of them to breaking point.  Then the rookie film-makers, split into two teams, head to the nearby island of Mafia, in the Indian Ocean, to try to get underwater footage of one of our best loved animals - the dolphin. Mafia is a popular destination, and the teams have to decide what to do when filming plans are interrupted by tourist boats. Dolphins are inquisitive and intelligent and can swim at speeds of up to 25mph, so getting good footage in the water will not be easy.

He wonders why square processed cheese slices are so popular - can it really be because they are so conveniently bread shaped? Why do they melt differently to 'normal cheese'? And if processed cheese only contains 60% cheese, what are the other ingredients?  To copy the factory processes, Jimmy makes supermarket bread in a metal dustbin, and square processed cheese slices using a tin bucket and an electric drill.  To complete his investigation Jimmy leaves the barn to find out how one bagged-salad producer in Wiltshire goes to herculean efforts to ensure we never find a caterpillar or bug in our bag, and how waste bananas are being used in Hertfordshire to grow tomatoes out of season.

Mishal Husain explores the dramatic last years of Gandhi's life and asks why he is revered as Father of the Nation, when India turned its back on his ideas.	In the final episode, Mishal Husain explores the dramatic last years of Gandhi's life, which culminated in his death by an assassin's bullet. She gets to the bottom of an enduring mystery - why is Gandhi revered as Father of the Nation, when India turned its back on Gandhi's blueprint for the country?   Mishal retraces Gandhi's visit to England in 1931 and uncovers evidence that Gandhi may have unwittingly contributed to the eventual partition of India. Newsreel footage from the time captures Gandhi meeting the people of Lancashire and London's East End, and Tony Benn recalls meeting him as a six-year-old boy. Sixteen years later India is free, but by then Gandhi is a broken man: sidelined from the centre of power and devastated by partition and the horrific violence that independence brings. But it is Gandhi's darkest hour that finally brings his greatest triumph.

James Lovelock discusses his controversial theory that proposes Earth be seen as a single living organism and the consequences that this could have for its future.	Great minds don't think alike. In fact, offbeat thinking has led to some of the greatest scientific discoveries of our age.  In the second of a three-part series uncovering the minds behind some of the greatest scientific discoveries of our age, James Lovelock explains how his maverick way of thinking led him not only to technical breakthroughs in atmospheric detection systems on Earth and Mars, but also to Gaia - a new way of thinking about the Earth as a holistic, self-regulating system.  He tells of his struggle against the scientific consensus of the day, the ridicule of his peers and his passionate belief that the mainstream scientific establishment stifles intellectual creativity.

Documentary following Dinah, an eight-month-old Australian dingo who is struggling to survive at the edge of the scorching Simpson Desert.	Dinah is an eight month old Dingo - an Australian wild dog halfway between a wolf and a domestic dog. Dingoes do things very differently from the marsupials that evolved down under. Suprisingly, the dingoes arrived in Australia by boat. Dinah's home is the central Australian outback, at the edge of the Simpson Desert, where temperatures reach 50 degrees centigrade in the middle of the day. Her life is one long hunt for food. She and her mum Sheila and her brother Dave will try to catch anything they can: goannas, thorny devils, skinks, frilled lizards, galahs, kangaroos... even camels. Amazingly, there are more wild camels in Australia than anywhere else in the world. They were introduced by the European settlers and, like the dingoes, were an important source of food, along with rabbits. When the going gets tough, is Dinah tough enough to survive?

Documentary following Larry, a Hanuman Langur living in the ancient city of Jodhpur. He is eight months old, lively, independent and always on the look out for fun.	Larry is a Hanuman Langur, a type of monkey named after the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman. He is eight months old, lively, independent and always on the lookout for fun. He lives in the centre of the ancient city of Jodhpur - the Blue City - at the edge of the Great Indian Desert, which is also home to more than 800 thousand people. The langur monkeys live on the roofs of houses, amongst the tangle of power lines and aerials. The monkey troop is centred on females: mothers and babies, aunts and grannies. Typically, they will stay in this close-knit family their whole lives, but one day Larry will be forced to leave. Larry's dad is the Lord of the Blue City, the only adult male in the troop and the father of all its youngsters. Larry has to learn to dodge traffic, to avoid electrocution and to steal food in the fruit market (monkey heaven). But there is another threat to the troop. Outside the city there is a tough bachelor gang of males. Their leader, a seasoned warrior called Scarface, wants to take over the Blue City. Can Larry's father survive his challenge?

Jerry Brotton shows how maps can be tools of power and snapshots of history. Henry VIII's maps of the British coast helped him exert control over the world.	In a series about the extraordinary stories behind maps, Professor Jerry Brotton uncovers how maps aren't simply about getting from A to B, but are revealing snapshots of defining moments in history and tools of political power and persuasion.   Visiting the world's first known map, etched into the rocks of a remote alpine hillside 3,000 years ago, Brotton explores how each culture develops its own unique, often surprising way of mapping. As Henry VIII's stunning maps of the British coastline from a bird's-eye view show, they were also used to exert control over the world.  During the Enlightenment, the great French Cassini dynasty pioneered the western quest to map the world with greater scientific accuracy, leading also to the British Ordnance Survey. But these new scientific methods were challenged by cultures with alternative ways of mapping, such as in a Polynesian navigator's map which has no use for north, south and east.  As scientifically accurate map-making became a powerful tool of European expansion, the British carved the state of Iraq out of the Middle East. When the British drew up Iraq's boundaries, they had devastating consequences for the nomadic tribes of Mesopotamia.

Jerry Brotton shows how maps can reveal the fears and prejudices of their age, from medieval religious passion to Victorian obsession with poverty and disease.	In a series about the extraordinary stories behind maps, Professor Jerry Brotton shows how maps can reveal the fears, obsessions and prejudices of their age.  Religious passion inspires beautiful medieval maps of the world, showing the way to heaven, the pilgrims' route to Jerusalem and monstrous children who eat their parents. But by the Victorian era society is obsessed with race, poverty and disease. Royal cartographer James Wyld's world map awards each country a mark from one to five, depending on how 'civilised' he deems each nation to be. And a map made to help Jewish immigrants in the East End inadvertently fuels anti-semitism.  'Map wars' break out in the 1970s when left-wing journalist Arno Peters claims that the world map shown in most atlases was a lie that short-changed the developing world. In Zurich, Brotton talks to Google Earth about the cutting edge of cartography and at Worldmapper he sees how social problems such as infant mortality and HIV are strikingly portrayed on computer-generated maps that bend the world out of shape and reflect the spirit of our age.

Professor Jerry Brotton uncovers how maps are snapshots of a moment in history and offer visions of distant lands, tempting explorers to plunder and conquer.	In the last of a three-part series about the extraordinary stories behind maps, Professor Jerry Brotton uncovers how maps are snapshots of a moment in history and offer visions of distant lands, tempting explorers to plunder and conquer.  However, adventurers first had to tackle the great challenge of mapping the globe onto a flat surface. There is no perfect solution, but the father of geography, Claudius Ptolemy, had some clever ideas.   Explorers like Christopher Columbus sailed into the unknown in search of riches and discovered a whole new continent that would become the most powerful on earth, while Amerigo Vespucci gave it his name.   Sir Walter Raleigh's treasure map of El Dorado in South America ultimately lost him his head. But the myth of El Dorado lived on, sending hundreds of men to their death in fruitless attempts to find the golden city.   As navigation became easier, maps enabled nations and enterprises like the Dutch East India Company to plunder far-off territories for spices, natural resources and gold. Even today, a project to map the North Pole is the flashpoint for the so-called 'Cold Rush' - the dash to exploit oil, gas and mineral reserves as the Arctic ice melts.

Cultural historian Andrew Hussey follows his success with France on a Plate by travelling back to his homeland, the north west of England, in search of its lost food culture.	Paris-based cultural historian Andrew Hussey follows his success with France on a Plate by travelling back to his homeland, the north west of England, in search of its lost food culture.   He brings with him the French idea of terroir, a term used by their wine growers and foodies - a belief that a food from a particular area is rendered unique though a particular set of local circumstances including culture and landscape.   As he wanders around the north west, Andrew asks if this rather highbrow foodie term can be applied to common northern grub such as a Blackpool chip or a Wigan pie. As he isn't a foodie he relies on local people to help him out, including three generations of a Wigan biker club and a woman who knows far too much about rhubarb.   In doing so, he uncovers some fascinating cultural history and the role of the Industrial Revolution in defining modern eating habits. And, most importantly, he redefines the concept of terroir by giving it a northern accent.

The story of how the north went from being Britain's economic engine room to cultural powerhouse. Andrew Martin explores how the north liberated itself and the country as a whole.	Documentary which sets out to show that the 1960s - the most creative decade of the 20th century - began not in swinging London but in smokestack northern England. It was from there that a new kind of voice was heard - cocky and defiant, working class, affluent, stroppy and sexy.   Novelist Andrew Martin explores how in 1960 the north asserted itself, came out of the closet artistically speaking, abandoned the cloth cap stereotype and in the process liberated itself and Britain as a whole. The story of how the north went from being the economic engine room of the country to cultural powerhouse is told through the work of northern writers such as Alan Sillitoe, Shelagh Delaney, Stan Barstow and Tony Warren. Thanks to their lead in conspicuously kicking over the old traces, by the end of 1960 if you wanted iconoclasm, humour, style and music, you definitely looked to the north.

The original film is followed by a report by Ashley's daughter Jackie on how it changed politics in the north of England.

Documentary exploring how, in the 1960s, the British people fell in love with animals and how endangered species and wildlife protection became an intrinsic part of our culture.	Timeshift explores the untold story of how Britain 'went wild' in the 1960s. It shows how the British people fell in love with animals and how, by the end of the decade, wildlife protection had become an intrinsic part of our culture. Before that time people knew very little about endangered species or the natural world - the very word 'environment' was hardly recognised. But the 1960s saw a sea change.   The film discovers how early television wildlife programmes with David Attenborough, writers such as Gerald Durrell and Gavin Maxwell and pioneers of conservation such as Peter Scott contributed to that transformation.

Documentary about primatologist Jane Goodall, who became accepted by a group of wild African chimpanzees and whose work transformed our understanding of man's closest relatives.	In 1960, a young secretary from Bournemouth, with no scientific qualifiactions, entered a remote forest in Africa and achieved something nobody else had ever done before. Jane Goodall became accepted by a group of wild chimpanzees, making discoveries that transformed our understanding of them, and challenged the way we define ourselves as human beings by showing just how close we are as a species to our nearest living relatives.   Since then, both she and the chimps of Gombe in Tanzania have become world famous - Jane as the beauty of many wildlife films, they as the beasts with something profound to tell us. As one of the programme's contributors, David Attenborough, suggests, Jane Goodall's story could be a fable if it wasn't true.   In this revealing programme filmed with Jane Goodall in Africa, we discover the person behind the myth, what motivates her and the personal cost her life's work has exacted from her - and why she still thinks we have a lot to learn from the chimps she has devoted her life to understanding.

It provides comfort, both physical and emotional. In this episode, which celebrates that dual role, the Hairy Bikers meet three great home cooks with a diverse range of recipes.   Dee's family is from Denby Dale, famous for its giant pies. She cooks up a meat and potato pie using a recipe handed over for the very first time from her father, who is well known for his perfect pies.   Anjie lives in Blackpool. Like her mother, Anjie loves to cook a curry. She finds comfort in using a home-made cookbook entitled Hug from Mum. It was compiled by her mother shortly before she died.   The third family live in the Calderdale Valley. Ruth and her mother Ann come from several generations of farmers. As well as a comforting ginger sponge and custard, they show Si and Dave their unusual 'dock pudding', made with leaves foraged from the pastures and traditionally eaten to celebrate the end of lambing.

Elaine's family favourite, the peach paradise pudding (a slice of 70s food heaven) and heart-warming chicken pie are the perfect hors d'oeuvre followed by Rosalyn's slow cooked beef stew and speedy plava cake. Then there's a rather savoury pudding of Jenny's pickled salads for raclette and an amazing morel mushroom sauce for roast chicken.   Si and Dave don't let the side down either with a brunch classic of banana pancakes with bacon. Also on the lazy weekends menu from the bikers are spiced tea-cakes and braised steaks with chips and gravy.  With the mums ready, hundreds of foodies descend on the Bikers' recipe fair. Amidst the recipe swapping and general mayhem, the bikers cook devilled kidneys, while food historian Gerard Baker challenges five recipe fair visitors to a skills challenge.   After all that hard work, there's only one thing left to do - enjoy the fruits of their lazy weekend cooking at the recipe fair banquet.

Series celebrating home cooking. The Bikers look at recipes that have arrived on British dinner-tables from distant shores, including paella and partridge escabeche.	Much of the great food we love is inspired by recipes from other countries. This journey is all about uncovering both familiar and more surprising recipes that have arrived on British dinner-tables from distant shores.  This episode's three mums all hail from Northern Ireland but cook food from all corners of the globe. Karen has Spanish delights to share, including a sensational paella and a simple but delicious recipe for Catalan tomato bread. Helen Mills cooks family recipes from Guyana including a fascinating take on chicken curry served with a handmade roti bread. And the final mum is, in fact, a dad! Conolly shares partridge escabeche, breasts of partridge pickled in white wine and vinegar, and some classic empanadas - Argentinian recipes from his mother cooked with great Northern Irish produce. All this culinary travel gets the Bikers' taste buds flowing, and they bring mulligatawny soup and a perfect pavlova to the party.  At the recipe fair, the Bikers cook their take on an international classic, haddock mornay, while food historian Gerard Baker invites the recipe fair visitors to a bakery challenge - plaited bread.

Series celebrating home cooking. The Bikers are on the hunt for three mums and their take on the perfect high tea. Dishes include beef and honey stew and meatloaf.	This episode celebrates the classic and uniquely British culinary invention of high tea. Almost every family has a different take on which recipes are best to fill up the family in the evening and so the Bikers are on the hunt for three mums and their take on the perfect high tea.  Like generations of farmers' wives before her, our first mum Polly has to feed her hungry husband and kids every night, so the recipes she shares have been tried and tested countless times over the years. Her beef and honey stew, and lamb and mint sausages never fail to impress.   Lisa is playing culinary detective, enlisting the help of the Bikers to uncover the mysteries of a family recipe book that hasn't been cooked with for years. The tasty results include simple meat patties and some great sweet-treats called diggers.   Nancy is the third mum and she shares a transatlantic take on tea with her mum's 'hockey puck' meatloaf and a great potato salad.   Inspired by the mums' culinary invention the Bikers cook up a great duo of savoury pies, and a divine lemon curd Swiss roll.  With the mums ready, hundreds of foodies descend on the Bikers' recipe fair. Amidst the recipe swapping and general mayhem the bikers create a teatime classic - meatballs in gravy. Meanwhile, food historian Gerard Baker challenges the recipe fair visitors to a historical skills challenge - making a pie known as a 'chacky pig'.

Series celebrating home cooking. In Wales, the Bikers meet three Mums who share their posh recipes: a Maltese stuffed marrow dish, cheesecake and orchid gateau.	In this rather up-market episode, the Bikers head to Wales for some posh nosh. They discover Welsh cuisine is far more sophisticated than leeks and laver bread as they meet three Mums, each with their own take on what makes food fancy. For Avis Davies, it's a Maltese stuffed marrow dish; Derith Rhisiart takes the humble Welsh cake as the basis for her very posh cheesecake, and for Jewish mum Ruth Joseph no posh table is complete without her special orchid gateaux, made in the tin her mother brought to Britain when fleeing Nazi Germany as a child.   The Bikers aren't too shabby either though. In a formal garden setting, they rustle up some double-baked cheese souffles before a quick game of polo on the lawn; and a stately home provides the location for their posh alter egos Archie and Gerald to enjoy some Biker-cooked lamb cutlets en croute with a red wine gravy.  With the Mums on board and their posh family recipes tried and tested, the Bikers head to the recipe fair where foodies from over the country have brought their family's bestest, most poshest recipes. Gerard, the food historian, is on hand to shed some light on where our posh nosh originated and also to devour the many, many cakes and other delicious morsels on hand. At the end of the day, the banquet is a feast of the ultimate poshness.

For 10,000 years or more, humans created new plant varieties for food by trial and error and a touch of serendipity. Then 150 years ago, a new era began. Pioneer botanists unlocked the patterns found in different types of plants and opened the door to a new branch of science - plant genetics. They discovered what controlled the random colours of snapdragon petals and the strange colours found in wild maize.  This was vital information. Some botanists even gave their lives to protect their collection of seeds.

Today, botanists believe advances in plant genetics hold the key to feeding the world's growing population.

Documentary series exploring the seas surrounding Great Britain. The team sets out to investigate the waters off the eastern coastline of Britain.	This time on Britain's Secret Seas, the team set out to explore the waters off our eastern coastline, which are constantly pounded by the raw power of the waves. These are the shallowest waters off our shores but over the centuries they have been some of our most productive, providing oil and gas as well as fish for our tables. But things are changing in the North Sea and our team discover a sea full of surprises.  On the Farne Islands, they come face to face with England's largest colony of grey seals to find out what makes them such extraordinary divers and successful hunters. Grey seals can dive for over forty minutes on a single breath - the team find out how they do it and why they seem to be coping with the changing conditions on the east coast far better than the harbour seal.  Elsewhere, Frank looks at the newest form of energy in the North Sea, at a wind farm off the Norfolk coast, and Tooni examines what effect the wind turbines are having on marine life. Paul uncovers the intriguing history of light vessels among the sandbanks of the Thames Estuary, and Tooni gets to the bottom of a bumper lobster harvest in the port of Bridlington.   Paul dives with a shoal of fish that soon transform into a school when he starts to behave as if he were a predator. To find out how they are able to achieve such synchronised motion and why they suddenly change direction, he joins a scientist who has created a plastic imposter - Robofish.

Can resignation ever be a social barometer of what's acceptable and what's not? Jacqui Smith is among those reliving the decision to stay or go.	Through personal testimony, this programme follows the process of resigning: from the initial crisis to taking the decision to resign and handling the timing, to the costs, consequences and legacy of the resignation.  It shows that the honourable resignation is not dead. In all walks of life people grappling with moral issues still take that decision to resign. Consultant anaesthetist Stephen Bolsin felt he could only go public after he had resigned and left the country.

The honourable resignations of Lord Carrington and Richard Luce were put back on track by a hostile parliament and press.  The programme charts how resignation can act as a social barometer - affairs that were once a fast route to leaving are no longer a career fullstop. Max Mosley talks frankly about how determined he was not to bow to pressure to go after revelations over his extra-marital sex.  Interviewees talk about their experiences and what they have learned. Alastair Campbell describes almost 'lamping' demonstrators outside his house. Greg Dyke can't sleep after his resignation 'deal' with the BBC governors goes wrong. Daily Star journalist Richard Peppiatt is plunged into depression after his plan to publish his resignation letter in the Guardian falls apart.

Broadcaster and gardener Sarah Raven is on a mission to halt the rapid decline in the UK's essential bees, butterflies and pollinating insects.	Writer, broadcaster and gardener Sarah Raven is on a mission to halt the rapid decline in Britain's essential bees, butterflies and pollinating insects by bringing flower power to towns, cities and the countryside.  The world's bees and other pollinating insects are in crisis. It is a complex problem that scientists the world over are trying to fathom, but the prognosis is grim - without healthy populations of insect pollinators across the world, our future food security is under threat.  Sarah Raven takes her mission out into the Great British countryside to encourage farmers and village communities to help recreate a network of crucial habitats for struggling bees, butterflies and pollinating insects.  With the loss of Britain's wildflower meadows and grasslands estimated at around 98 per cent, Sarah finds out whether we have simply lost our connection with the wildflowers and habitats that were once so common and supported our pollinators.  Sarah starts by attempting to change the attitude of just one small Northamptonshire village. Today tidiness rules and the village green is a close mown carpet of green. Will the village take to her plans and embrace wildflowers, or will tidiness prevail?  Sarah also meets the Farringtons - a Northamptonshire farming family spanning three generations. Duncan, who now runs the farm, investigates sowing perennial wildflower borders around his crops to increase habitats for insect pollinators and possibly to increase crop yields.  And at home, Sarah visits wildflower meadows and harvests wildflower seed in order to develop her own wildflower meadow, something everyone can do in their own community or at home.

Gardener and broadcaster Sarah Raven finds out whether British gardens could become a network of mini nature reserves for pollinating insects.	In the second programme of this three-part series, Sarah Raven takes her mission to halt the rapid decline in Britain's essential bees, butterflies and pollinating insects to our towns, and challenges the RHS Britain in Bloom competition to make their floral displays more nectar- and pollen-rich, to help to increase the amount of food and habitat for pollinating insects throughout the spring and summer months.  With the use of intensive farming methods, regionalisation of crops, and the loss of wildflower meadows and grasslands estimated at around 98 per cent, the countryside can be feast or famine for the pollinators. So Sarah finds out whether British gardens could become a network of mini nature reserves for the pollinating insects.  Sarah starts her campaign by attempting to change the attitude of Harrogate's successful gold medal-winning Britain in Bloom group. She challenges them to embrace nectar- and pollen-rich flowers over traditional bedding plants. Will the Bloom group take to her plans and ideas, or will the begonia bunch stand firm?  Sarah also challenges the UK gardening industry, the Horticultural Trades Association and the Royal Horticultural Society to champion pollinating insects by launching a 'pollinator-friendly' logo at the Chelsea Flower Show. The logo and label would enable gardeners to identify the best plants for bees and butterflies throughout garden centres and nurseries in the UK.  And at home, Sarah meets expert garden naturalist Steve Head, and explores her own garden's suitability for insect pollinators. Inspired by what she discovers, she develops a nectar garden - a mini oasis for pollinators.

In the third and final programme of the series, Sarah Raven takes her mission to halt the rapid decline in Britain's essential bees, butterflies and pollinating insects to our cities and challenges our city parks departments to sow nectar rich modern meadows, and to make their floral displays more nectar and pollen rich to help to increase the amount of food and habitat for pollinating insects.  With the use of intensive farming methods, regionalisation of crops, and the loss of wildflower meadows and grasslands estimated at around 98%, the countryside can be feast or famine for our pollinators. So Sarah discovers how our cities and sprawling urban landscapes can play their part and become pollen and nectar rich networks of modern meadows and nectar rich flower displays.  Sarah starts her campaign in Birmingham.

The park is the biggest to be built in the UK for decades, and tens of thousands of square metres of modern pollinator friendly meadows are being sown to come into glorious flower for the games in August 2012. Sarah gets an exclusive preview of the ground breaking biodiverse and pollinator friendly landscaping.  And at home Sarah puts modern meadow seed mixes to the test for people and pollinators alike. She wants to see if the seed mixes can pack a floral punch and supply our pollinators with a flow of pollen and nectar throughout the year.

Journalist and historian Max Hastings examines the legacy of the Falklands War and how it revived Britain's armed forces and its reputation as a military power.	Thirty years after the Falklands War, journalist and military historian Max Hastings explores the conflict's impact and its legacy.   Hastings, who sailed with the Task Force in 1982 and reported on the Falklands campaign first-hand, looks at how victory in the South Atlantic revived the reputation of our armed forces and renewed Britain's sense of pride and its image abroad after years of decline as an imperial and military power.   Hastings examines how the Falklands provided a model of a swift and successful war that was matched by other conflicts Britain fought at the end of the 20th century. In contrast, the long campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan have left the British public sceptical about sending our armed forces in large numbers to war again.  The Falklands could well be the last popular war Britain fights, and certainly the country's last imperial hurrah.

Historian Dominic Sandbrook takes viewers on an eye-opening and refreshing journey deep into the 1970s, a decade where the old Britain of the post-war years was transformed into the nation of today.This episode looks at the Britain of 1975-77. New sex discrimination laws challenged the British bloke, while football hooliganism and industrial unrest heralded the end of the post-war peace. Equal pay and rights meant that women could, technically, work on an equal standing to men. Dominic contrasts their new 'equality' with the epidemic of casual sexism in British culture. Fighting on the football terraces brought the national game into disrepute, while in industry there was a sense that Britain was slipping out of control: despite the government ploughing millions into British Leyland, the company was unable to control its workforce or to make cars that people wanted.And in the midst of silver jubilee fever, a different cultural force was challenging society.

Is this the site of the legendary 'Lost Kingdom of Lyonesse', said to be the last resting place of King Arthur?  On precipitous slopes, beyond the edge of Devon, Coast newcomer and social historian Ruth Goodman follows in the footsteps of the remarkable Branscombe cliff farmers, who for generations followed a hardy way of life that's now gone with the sea breeze.

And, on the dramatic rocky edge of St David's Head in south Wales, Hermione Cockburn explores the very limits of life on the planet to reveal the astonishing fossil of a large sea creature - one which lived 300 million years before the dinosaurs. This discovery helped establish that Britain and America were once part of the same super-continent, and that the Earth is old enough for Darwin's theory of evolution - once held to be on the margins of science - to become central to our understanding of who we are.

Documentary series about Britain's motorways. This final episode explores how people questioned the promises made by the motorways and began to protest.	When the first motorways opened they did so to national celebration. But after the first 1,000 miles had been built, their impact on both town and country was becoming apparent and people started to protest.   Middle England rose up and disrupted public inquiries to voice their frustration at motorway building, but it continued and over time the frustration gave way to concerns about saving the planet. In the early 1990s that meant young people willing to risk everything to stop the motorways being built. The programme shows how people began to question the promises made by the motorway, and along the way found their voice of protest.

Experimenters Lewis, Mason and Sam visit Nina in her lab and find out that the senses are really important in remembering things. They discover that smelling, tasting, seeing, hearing or touching something can spark a memory. So tasting some popcorn can remind them of going to the cinema.   A second experiment shows them that the more senses someone uses to examine something, the stronger the memory of it gets, helping them to remember it later. Finally they go to a beach and make paths in the sand. They see that once a path is made, it's easy to follow it again. And the more they follow it, the deeper and clearer the path gets. Nina explains that this is like memory. Each memory is like a path in the brain and the more often you remember something, the easier it is to remember it again.

But it is really important that the broken bone cannot break apart again while it is growing back together. So a hard cast is placed around the broken bone while it heals. Nina and the Experimenters have fun sticking some pretend broken bones back together and make casts to hold them still.

Experimenters Emilija, Mya and Toni visit Nina in her lab. They discover that they can use their fingertips to work out if objects are wet or dry and hot or cold. Nina explains that sense of touch helps people to stay safe. If the fingertips feel that something is too hot or prickly, a message is sent to the brain to pull the hand away.   Next they go and have fun on a special floor which lights up and makes noises when it is touched. They discover that the floor contains something called sensors. These are a bit like the nerves in skin which sense things and send messages to the brain. Different nerves sense different things like hot and cold or wet and dry.   Back at the lab, they put on blindfolds and feel objects with their elbows and feet. They have trouble working out what the things are. Nina explains that fingertips are much better at feeling things than elbows or feet. This is because the skin on the fingertips is jam-packed with more different types of nerves than any other part of the body.

Scientist Nina and her young experimenters investigate the human body. Experimenters Eilidh and Travis visit Nina in her lab and discover amazing facts about hearts.	Nina investigates why hearts beat with the help of her five sense neurons.   Experimenters Eilidh and Travis visit Nina in her lab. They use their senses to see what a heart looks like, and they feel and hear their own hearts beating inside their chests. Next, they go to a fun park and go on a white-water ride. They discover that hearts beat because they are pumping blood around our bodies, day and night, just like the water is pumped around the ride.   Back at the lab, they find out that the heart pumps the blood around the body because blood has important things in it that the body needs, like oxygen and good stuff from the food we eat. They all do some star jumps and notice that their hearts are beating faster. Nina explains that when we do exercise, our heart beats and pumps blood around our body faster to deliver more of the important things the body needs.

Nina investigates why people have two ears, with the help of Belle, her hearing neuron.   Experimenters Eve, Finlay and Lana visit Nina in her lab. They do a listening experiment and discover that in a noisy place, when there are lots of different sounds happening at once, it is easier to make out what someone is saying when you use both ears.   Next the children go outside and prepare to cross the road safely with Nina. They find out that it is important to listen carefully when crossing a road as you can sometimes hear a car before you can see it. And they notice that they can also hear which direction the car noise is coming from.   Back in the lab, they do an experiment and discover that the brain is able to work out where a noise is coming from because people have two ears. Nina explains that this is because a sound reaches the ear closest to it first.

Nina investigates why people have a brain with the help of her five sense neurons.  Experimenters Chevaz, Kian and Shay visit Nina in her lab and discover that the amazing brain is the control centre for the body - in fact, the bossy brain tells the body what to do! A game with some remote-control cars helps them to find out more. Nina explains that the remote controls are sending invisible messages to the cars, telling them to move. And the brain controls the body by sending invisible messages too.  These messages are delivered by something called motor neurons. But the body can send messages back to our brain too, using sense neurons. A final experiment with a giant digger, a big pile of sand and some walkie-talkies explains how this works!

Nina helps Chloe and Jodi to do an experiment with some stretchy material and find out that skin is elastic.	Nina investigates why Grandpa Jim's face is wrinkly with the help of Luke, her sight neuron.   Experimenters Chloe and Jodi bring their grandpa to Nina's lab and discover that his face wasn't always wrinkly. When he was younger his skin was smooth like theirs. They do an experiment with some stretchy material and find out that skin is elastic. This means that when it is stretched, it pings back to how it was before. But Grandpa Jim's skin doesn't ping back as quickly as the girls' does.   Then they all go to a beauty salon and Nina and the twins have some face masks put onto their skin. They try to pull faces for Grandpa Jim but the hard masks stop them from moving their faces. Nina explains that people need their skin to be stretchy and elastic so that they can make faces, talk and move their bodies.  Back in the lab, they discover that when people move their faces to smile, talk or frown, their skin stretches and crinkles up in certain places. When people get older, the skin doesn't smooth back out again because the body makes less of something called collagen. So they get wrinkles in the places that were crinkled up. This is a natural part of growing older.

Experimenters Catriona and Luke visit Nina in her lab and discover that anything that makes people move their bodies can be exercise. And exercise is good because it keeps bodies fit and healthy.  Next, they go to see some young people play wheelchair basketball. They are invited to join in and find out that this is a really fun type of exercise that makes their arms really strong! Finally, back in the lab, they have more fun pedalling special exercise bikes and discover that exercise is good for minds as well as bodies. Nina explains that exercise releases things called endorphins in our brain that make people feel happy.

Scientist Nina and her young experimenters investigate the human body. Experimenters Breagh and Zoe visit Nina in her lab to learn about tickles.	Scientist Nina and her young experimenters investigate the human body and find out why it is brilliant.  Nina investigates why feet are so ticklish, with the help of Felix, her touch neuron. Experimenters Breagh and Zoe visit Nina in her lab and find out that tickles are caused when something touches the skin very, very lightly. Nina explains that it is thought that the reason the body wriggles and pulls away from a tickle is because this feels like an insect is on the skin. As some insects bite, the body tries to shake the tickly thing off.   Then they go to a restaurant kitchen and see a temperature sensor being used to test if foods are hot or cold. Nina explains that skin has sensors in it too, called nerves. Some nerves can sense hot or cold, but others feel the very light touch of a sneaky tickle.   Back at the lab, they do an experiment to test which parts of the body are the most ticklish. Nina explains that feet have more of the special nerves that sense tickles than any other part of the body. And that's why feet are so ticklish!

Nina investigates where food goes when you eat it, with the help of Bud, her taste neuron. Experimenters Arianna and Maria visit Nina in her lab and find out all about food's amazing journey through the digestive system.   They visit a giant slide and discover that it's important to eat lots of fibre foods and drink plenty of water, to keep things moving though the intestines. Back in the lab, they push some mashed-up food though a model of the intestine. They see that that some parts of the food squeeze through tiny holes in the intestine into the body.   Nina explains that bodies use these parts of food to make energy and help keep you healthy. Other parts of the food, like fibre, are left over and are pushed out of the body into the toilet as poo. But they have still done an important job in the digestive system, keeping things moving so you don't get a sore tummy.

Nina investigates why people have to sleep, with the help of her five sense neurons.   Experimenters Kirsty, Olim and Tegan visit Nina in her lab. They find out that babies and children need more sleep than grown-ups because sleep is really important in helping their brilliant bodies to grow. Next, they visit a post office and see the postman sorting the letters so they won't get lost. Nina explains that when people sleep, their brains sort out all of the information they have taken in from their senses during the day. It is thought that this helps us to remember things later on.  Back at the lab, the children play with some very lively toys. They see that when the toys' batteries run out, they stop moving. Nina recharges the batteries so that the toys can be full of energy again. She explains that people run out of energy too at the end of a long day. So they need to get plenty of sleep to give their brilliant bodies time to recharge.

Nina investigates what scabs are for, with the help of Luke, her sight neuron.   Experimenters Megan, Oscar and Ross visit Nina in her lab and do an experiment with leaky buckets. They discover that scabs form over cuts in skin to stop the blood from leaking out. Next, they go and play football on a grass pitch. Nina's heel damages the grass when she tries to save a goal. They discover that a special kind of material can be used to cover the damaged grass, protecting it while it grows back. Scabs help to protect damaged skin too, a bit like the body's own natural plaster.   Back at the lab, they discover that scabs also do the important job of keeping nasty germs out of a cut. Germs can cause an infection and make people feel ill. Nina explains that this is one of the reasons why people shouldn't pick scabs, because then they could become infected.

Experimenters Megan, Thomas and Zara visit Nina in her lab and discover that round eyeballs are brilliant at rolling around. This means that people can look in lots of different directions without moving their heads.   They visit a theatre and find out that eyes need light to see. The light enters the eye through the little black circle called the pupil, and the coloured part of the eye - the iris - opens and closes to let more light into the eye when it is darker, and less light in when it is bright.   Back at the lab, they play a game of catch and discover that having two eyes helps people to work out how near or far away something is.

Experimenters Brodie, Callum and Maykl visit Nina in her lab and discover that the bubbles in fizzy drinks are made of a type of gas. Nina explains that when people drink fizzy drinks, or just eat or drink too quickly, gas can build up in their tummies, so they burp to get rid of it!   Next they visit a lighthouse to hear how a gas, like air, can make a loud noise when it is pushed though a foghorn. Back in the lab, they do a noisy experiment with balloons and discover that the burping noise is made when gas from people's tummies pushes past a muscle at the top of the food tube, making it wobble. Nina reminds everyone that burping can be rude.

Scientist Nina and her young experimenters investigate the human body. Experimenters Cara, Kai and Rianna visit Nina in her lab and discover why people's backs feel bumpy.	Nina investigates why people's backs are so bumpy, with the help of Felix, her touch neuron.   Experimenters Cara, Kai and Rianna visit Nina in her lab and find out that backs feel bumpy because the backbone - or spine - is made up of lots of little hard bones. These protect something called the spinal cord which the brain uses to talk to the rest of the body.   They go to an exercise class and do lots of bendy, stretchy moves. Nina explains that people are able to bend and stretch in lots of different, useful ways because the spine is made up of lots of little bones, not one big, long, hard bone.   Back in the lab, they do a smashing experiment with eggs and discover that there are little soft discs between the bones in the spine. These act as little cushions, stopping the bones from bashing together when people move.

Scientist Nina and her young experimenters investigate the human body and find out why it is brilliant.  Nina investigates how people breathe, with the help of sense neurons Bud and Ollie. Experimenters Freya, Laura and Wannie visit Nina in her lab and discover that people have two stretchy lungs inside their chests that fill up with air when they breathe in. Using a model of the chest, they find out how a stretchy muscle called the diaphragm pulls the air down into the lungs and then pushes it back out again.   Next they discover that air travels though little tubes inside the lungs. If someone has asthma, the little air tubes can get narrower some of the time and this can make it harder to breathe. But a special medicine from the doctor can be used to make the air tubes wider again.   In their final experiment, they pretend a glass lift is the windpipe and discover that little air sacs inside the lungs take oxygen from the air that is breathed in and give it to the body. The oxygen is used for lots of important jobs.

Experimenters Ciaran, Harry and Jordan visit Nina in her lab and find out that skin is like a rucksack for the body, keeping the insides safe and in place.   Then they visit a car wash and discover that skin is also good at keeping things out of bodies, such as dirt and germs. And skin is waterproof too, which is a good thing when you have a bath!   Back in the lab, they use their magnifying glasses to see that people have lots of tiny hairs in their skin. Nina explains that when people are cold, the tiny hairs stand up, helping to trap warm air and warm them up. Skin also helps to cool people down when they are too hot by making them sweat.

Laura and Jamie are struggling to cope with the everyday challenges of raising their baby, so the last thing they need is a big family event. But the christening is looming and they are nowhere near ready for it.   Mike is desperate to prove himself worthy of being a godfather, much to atheist Beth's irritation. But Mike has got stiff competition from Jamie's cousin Conall, a trainee priest.   Keith, under pressure from Sandra, is forced to take temping work at the toy shop to help pay for the christening. But Keith finds it hard to cope when he discovers his new supervisor is his son.   All is not well with Laura's family either. Janet is trying to put a halt to the christening, which she feels will bring public shame on the family. Part of Laura would like the whole christening to go away too, but Jamie, under pressure from his family, is saying they can't back out.  Alan is still recovering from his head injury, so Janet wants to go back to work, although she's not mentioning this to Alan.   As the visiting relatives arrive, squabble and then criticise, Jamie and Laura are really feeling the pressure - and they haven't even managed to agree on a name yet.

Coast celebrates the surprising stories of the workers from around our shores. From foundry men who burnished the secrets of our sea power, to the superstar performers who wowed the crowds in Edwardian resorts, these are tales of the hard grafters who made Britain great.  Nick Crane tells the tale of an abandoned refrigeration plant whose workers kept Britain's biggest fishing fleet afloat. How did their ingenious production line create the tons of ice needed each day to keep the fish from Grimsby's trawlers fresh for the nation's plates? The Grimsby Ice Factory, dating from 1901, was one of the few sites in the country that could freeze water on an industrial scale. The Ice Factory closed in 1990, but the last man to work there returns to bring the whole process back to life.  At the port on the River Tyne, Nick joins a team of drivers on a race against time to precision-park hundreds of new British-built cars aboard a huge purpose-built car-transporter.   Neil Oliver relives a remarkable tale - when thousands of shipyard workers on the river Clyde fought job losses not by walking out on strike, but by 'working-in'. In 1971 the Clydeside work-in was a revolutionary new tactic; the struggle to keep on working whatever the bosses said attracted worldwide financial support, including red roses and cash from John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It is credited with saving shipbuilding on the upper Clyde, but is the legend of the work-in all that it seems? For the first time, the man the government put in charge of the yards tells the story from his perspective, a version of events which re-writes the accepted history.  Tessa Dunlop reveals the untold story of the secret of the Royal Navy's sea power, some 200 years ago. In Nelson's navy the British guns were more accurate than those of our enemies, thanks to our ability to manufacture super-smooth and perfectly round cannonballs. The secret ingredient was a rare mineral called plumbago. The purest plumbago existed in only one mine in the world, near the port of Whitehaven. Tessa explores the abandoned mine workings to find the long-forgotten source of plumbago. Can she rediscover its remarkable properties by making her own cannonballs?  And Ken Dodd joins Ian McMillan to celebrate the entertainers who worked so hard to get laughs from the holidaymakers of Blackpool in its heyday. For one night only they stage a unique show at the resort's historic Grand Theatre: Edwardian Britain's Got Seaside Talent! Mega-stars of the Edwardian age, like 'Little Titch', were household names, while Vesta Tilley's cross-dressing turn as a young dandy-about-town earned her the equivalent of Â£20,000 per week. Will their acts still stand up today? Tribute acts take to the stage to find out.

To discover the pure pleasure of seaside leisure, the team seek out the ideal locations to enjoy their personal passions and experience the joy of the coast.  Nick Crane heads to the Western Isles in Scotland to attempt a daunting, long-coveted, mountaineering challenge on the Isle of Skye. For years, Nick has dreamed of climbing the fearsome Cioch. This singular and impressive spear of rock, the scene for a spectacular sword fight in the film Highlander, was only conquered for the first time in 1906. The men who originally attempted the hazardous route to its summit were John Mackenzie, a Scottish mountain guide, and Norman Collie, an English professor of chemistry. Nick uses Victorian mountaineering gear as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of Mackenzie and Collie and climb the Cioch. Along the way he learns something of the triumph and tragedy of their lives, but Nick's reward at the climax of the hazardous ascent comes with the discovery of a new favourite view, an incredible seascape framed by Britain's most glorious coastal peaks.  Nick also reveals how, in the mid 19th century, Thomas Cook was inspired by the new steamships criss-crossing Scottish seas to create his package tours, a concept that Cook went on to promote worldwide.  To get some tips for completing a complex fisherman's jumper, Ruth Goodman heads to Polperro.

5938229944168473479	The Ottomans: Europe's Muslim Emperors	24/10/2013	60			Rageh Omaar begins his examination of the Ottoman empire by looking at its unlikely roots.	Rageh Omaar examines the history of the Ottoman empire. He starts by looking at the unlikely roots of the Ottomans, as nomadic horsemen in a rural backwater of modern-day Turkey.	It was the world's last Islamic empire - a superpower of a million square miles. From its capital in Istanbul it matched the glories of Ancient Rome. And after six centuries in power it collapsed less than a hundred years ago.  Rageh Omaar, who has reported from across this former empire, sets out to discover why the Ottomans have vanished from our understanding of the history of Europe, why so few realise the importance of Ottoman history in today's Middle East, and why you have to know the Ottoman story to understand the roots of many of today's trouble spots, from Palestine, Iraq and Israel to Libya, Syria, Egypt, Bosnia and Kosovo.  In this first episode, the unlikely roots of the Ottomans are revealed. From nomadic horsemen, in a rural backwater of modern-day Turkey, they became rulers of a vast empire spanning three continents. At an incredible speed they came to rule over Baghdad and Cairo in the south, where they controlled the holiest sites of Islam - Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem, and they reached deep into Europe, taking in Sarajevo and threatening the gates of Vienna.   This is the forgotten story of how one dynasty, a single family, became Islamic rulers over huge swathes of the modern world.

Continuing his fascinating journey to rediscover the central role played by the Ottoman empire in Europe and the Middle East, Rageh Omaar explores the huge contrasts in the times of two very different Ottoman sultans. The famed Suleiman the Magnificent in the golden age of the 16th century and the troubled reign of Abdul Hamid II in the 19th century, when the Ottomans were dubbed 'the Sick Man of Europe'.  To find out what a Muslim world run from Europe was really like, Rageh examines the cultural legacy of the empire, as well as the physical, religious and political architecture of Ottoman rule. It reveals the backdrop to the relationship between Islam and Europe today, how the Ottomans became central in the power politics of the continent and what could have happened had they succeeded in their successive bids to seize Vienna, then a key European capital.

Rageh Omaar ends his series with a look at how the collapse of the Ottoman Empire created a legacy of tension and conflict that continues to this day.	In the final episode, Rageh Omaar explains how the collapse of this Islamic superpower following the First World War has left problems for Europe and the Middle East that are still being felt today. Rageh also reveals how struggles at the heart of the Ottoman story have have recently been reignited on the streets they once ruled, from Syria to Turkey.  From its capital in Istanbul, the Ottoman Empire matched the glories of ancient Rome. Yet its achievements have been largely lost in the trauma of its last few years. Brutality, massacres and the carve-up of former Ottoman lands created a legacy of tension and conflict that continue to this day.  The heartland of the former empire - modern-day Turkey - turned its back on its Islamic, Ottoman past. It underwent a social revolution led by military commander and secular visionary Mustafa Kemal- Ataturk. So why is Ottomanism back on the political agenda? And why are many politicians in the west hoping that Turkey can provide a role model as a modern, Islamic democracy?

After decades of silence, British, American and Russian submariners talk about the secret war of espionage waged beneath the waves during the Cold War.	For decades, Britain and America's Cold War submarines waged a secret war of espionage against the Soviet navy. Deep in the ocean, crews were locked in a game of cat and mouse as each side battled to gain the tactical and technological advantage.  After decades of silence, submariners from both the east and west are now allowed to talk more openly than ever before about how they plotted to win the war beneath the waves. The west's superior technology allowed them to secretly shadow the Soviet fleet, at close quarters, giving them vital intelligence and the upper hand if war broke out.  Shadowing submarines was dangerous. The film explores close encounters between western and Soviet forces that put the lives of submariners at risk. Candid interviews with British, American and Russian submariners reveal the pressures of lengthy underwater patrols that drove them to the edge of their physical and mental limits.

Jeremy Clarkson tells the story of the Arctic convoys of WWII, which delivered vital war supplies to the Soviet Union via the Arctic, and reveals the convoy's greatest disaster.	Jeremy Clarkson tells the dramatic story of the Arctic convoys of the Second World War, from Russia to the freezing Arctic Ocean.  Accompanied by moving first hand testimony from the men who served on these convoys, Clarkson reveals the incredible hazards faced by members of the Merchant and Royal Navy who delivered vital war supplies via the Arctic to the Soviet Union: temperatures of minus 50 degrees, huge icebergs, colossal waves, not to mention German U-boats and the Luftwaffe. It is no wonder that Churchill described the Arctic Convoys as 'the worst journey in the world.'  Between 1941 and 1945, more than 70 convoys delivered 4 million tonnes of material to the USSR, yet one convoy in partiuclar would come to symbolise the dangers faced by the men who served on them. Codenamed PQ17, this convoy of 35 merchant ships would be described by Churchill as one of the most melancholy naval episodes of the war.  Retracing the route of PQ17 from the Arctic to the Russian winter port of Archangel, Clarkson reveals how, on the night of July 4th 1942, this joint Anglo-American convoy became one of the biggest naval disasters of the 20th century. To make matters worse, the cause of the disaster lay not in the brutal conditions of the Arctic, or the military might of the Germans, but a misjudgement made in the corridors of the Admiralty in London.

Jules Hudson is also in the county, on the Severn Valley Railway, meeting the volunteers who spend the winter months spring cleaning the trains and the tracks.   Every year we throw away millions of tonnes of food in the UK, so could some hungry animals stop it all going to waste? Tom Heap looks at the idea that discarded food could be turned into pigswill. But, as he discovers, not everyone is quite so keen.  Adam Henson heads to Somerset, one of the areas worst affected by the winter floods, to meet a farmer who is battling on despite more than 95% of his land being under water.

Neil Oliver joins a team of historians and scientists investigating the final resting place of Alfred the Great as they exhume the contents of an unmarked grave.	Neil Oliver is given exclusive access to a team of historians and scientists investigating the final resting place of Alfred the Great. Alfred's bones have been moved so many times over the centuries that many people concluded that they were lost forever. Following a trail that goes back over 1,000 years, the team wants to unravel the mystery of Alfred's remains. Travelling from Winchester to Rome, Neil also tells the extraordinary story of Alfred's life - in the 9th century, he became one of England's most important kings by fighting off the Vikings, uniting the Anglo-Saxon people and launching a cultural renaissance. This was the man who forged a united language and identity, and laid the foundations of the English nation.    The film investigates the equally extraordinary story of what happened to Alfred's remains after his death in 899. They have been exhumed and reburied on a number of occasions since his original brief burial in the Anglo-Saxon Old Minster in Winchester. The Saxons, the Normans, Henry VIII's religious reformers, 18th-century convicts, Victorian romantics and 20th-century archaeologists have all played a part in the story of Alfred's grave.    Neil joins the team as they exhume the contents of an unmarked grave, piece the bones together and have them dated. With the discovery of some unexpected new evidence, the film reveals the extraordinary outcome of an important investigation.

Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani set off across Russia on two road trips starting from Sochi. Anita is out to discover 'new' Russia, while Justin heads east into 'old' Russia.	Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani set off across Russia on two massive road trips across the world's biggest, and one of its most enigmatic, countries. A former superpower and more recently a struggling giant, Russia is looking to assert itself once again on the world stage. With millions of square miles of land, a wealth of natural resources, the largest automobile market in Europe, diverse borders and trading partners aplenty, Russia has the potential to become one of the richest and most dynamic nations on earth. But 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, how far has Russia left its Cold War past behind? And what direction will the country take? Driving thousands of miles in three weeks, and in two very different cars, Justin and Anita find out.   Anita and Justin begin their journeys in Sochi, the Black Sea resort home to the 2014 Winter Olympics, the most expensive games ever. Full of futuristic architecture, this is new Russia's glittering showcase to the world, but just round the corner from the glitzy stadiums is Joseph Stalin's old dacha, a reminder that in Russia the old and the new are often very close.   Anita is out to discover 'new' Russia. She travels north and west from Sochi in a Kombat, a Russian built luxury armoured plated bling machine - her oligarch tank. She enters a thriving world of westernised entrepreneurs, the mega-rich and rebellious youth, people who are at the forefront of shaping a new and vibrant Russia.   On her first leg she drives to the western port of Taganrog, enters a vast iron ore mine near Kursk, and makes her way up to Kaluga, a city once at the heart of one of Russia's poorest regions, and now a centre of industry with western factories including Volkswagen transforming its fortunes.   Meanwhile Justin heads east into 'old' Russia where he encounters a very different world in his chosen vehicle: a slightly battered Soviet-built UAZ 'jeep' first designed in the 1940s for the Red Army. He meets traditional Russians and encounters a land that seems hardly to have changed since before the Cold War years.   On the first half of his journey, Justin drives to a vast farm, once a Soviet Collective, before making his way alongside the Volga, Russia's 'Mother River', and to Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) where he meets WWII veterans of the Battle of Stalingrad, before heading to the vast Lada car factory.

With predictions of more frequent and severe storms, Tom asks what's the best way to protect our shores in the future.  Adam Henson is in Kent, visiting one of the finest, record-breakingly expensive bulls in the world.

Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani continue their epic road trips across Russia, discovering two very different sides of a vast and bewildering country looking to assert itself once again on the world stage.  Having started out at Sochi, the Black Sea resort hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics, Anita is in Moscow where she meets wealthy socialite Alisa Krylova, Pussy Riot protester Yekaterina 'Katia' Samutsevich and some rebellious night drag-racers and their souped-up cars. She then moves on to St Petersburg, Russia's former capital and its gateway to the west. She gets the chance to open a massive bridge and behind the tourist sites she finds a city of migrant workers and gay rights protesters.  Anita then turns north to meet entrepreneurs harvesting caviar from sturgeon stocked in the warm waters of a nuclear power plant, before reaching her final destination of Murmansk, high in the arctic and Russia's new economic frontier.  Justin continues on his journey east, from Perm and one of the last Gulag prison camps, deep into the Ural Mountains and Asia. He spends time with some very traditional bear hunters, gets close to some powerful military buyers at Russia's biggest arms fair, and drives on to Yekaterinburg, where he comes a little too close to men protecting the graves of local gangsters from the 1990s.   Finally, Justin reaches the lands of Russia's incredibly rich natural resources - a world of grim copper smelters, Cold War nuclear bomb-making plants, and a road that seems to go on forever into Siberia, looking east towards China and Japan.

6092886133039997522	Our War	15/12/2014	90	factual		The story of the Afghanistan war through the words and pictures of soldiers who fought it.	Marking the end of the British campaign in Helmand, this documentary tells the story of the Afghanistan war through the words and pictures of the soldiers who fought it.	Marking the end of the British campaign in Helmand, this documentary tells the story of the Afghanistan war through the words and pictures of the soldiers who fought it.  The 13-year campaign has been documented like no other conflict, by young soldiers who took video cameras into battle, recording the war as only they could see it. The Ministry of Defence and the soldiers have allowed BBC filmmakers to use this remarkable footage to tell the real story of this modern war.  The soldiers' individual stories are gripping and often deeply moving - from the intimate account of a platoon sergeant who lost one of his men just two weeks into their tour and the terrifying moment a British Apache helicopter fired on its own men with devastating consequences for one 18-year-old paratrooper, to the eye-opening testimony of a surgeon working in Bastion field hospital at the height of the IED threat and the dramatic scenes when a war-weary sergeant leads his men into a surprise attack on one of the Taliban's largest bomb-making factories.  The soldiers, some of them a decade older than when they first went to fight, some still barely out of their teens, recall their extraordinary experiences in intimate first-hand testimonies. As well as recounting their personal stories of war, they chart the bigger picture of how this small mission escalated into a prolonged stand-off with a determined and capable enemy.   The film catches up with the soldiers today in bittersweet moments of reflection - many have left the army, often for medical reasons, and all of their lives are dominated by the legacy of this long and brutal war.

Una Stubbs and Richard Bacon take ten amateur artists to stunning locations across the country for a tough series of painting and drawing challenges.	This series presented by Una Stubbs and Richard Bacon takes ten amateur artists to stunning locations across the country to battle it out in a tough series of painting and drawing challenges for the title of Britain's best amateur artist.   The competition starts in Alnwick Castle in Northumberland - known to many as Hogwarts - where expert judges Lachlan Goudie and Daphne Todd OBE set their first challenge to see each artist's unique painting style for the first time.   Eyebrows are raised as one artist starts by painting her whole canvas bright red whilst another paints what looks like a lion straddling a cannon. As paint is put to canvas Una and Richard learn what drives each artist's passion for painting - and what it would mean for them to win.  The second challenge each week is a quick-draw challenge. In this episode the artists must sketch, at speed, a delphinium flower. Expert judge Lachlan Goudie shows us his tips on how to capture the beauty and complexity of a flower.   Their final challenge is to paint the formidable castle from across the banks of the River Aln. Getting a sense of depth into their paintings proves more difficult than many think. While some thrive painting outdoors, others who've only ever painted in the comfort of their spare bedrooms have to adapt quickly to the challenges of the changing light.  Una travels to the V&A museum in London to view one of the most famous landscapes - John Constable's The Hay Wain - and artist Fraser Scarfe tries to convince her that there's more to it than its chocolate-box reputation.   Back in the castle, the judges take on the role of executioner as they have the difficult job of deciding which amateur artist won't see it through to the next week.

A look at how the Normans developed from a band of marauding Vikings into the formidable warriors who conquered England in 1066.	In the first episode of a three-part series, Professor Robert Bartlett explores how the Normans developed from a band of marauding Vikings into the formidable warriors who conquered England in 1066. He tells how the Normans established their new province of Normandy -'land of the northmen' - in northern France. They went on to build some of the finest churches in Europe and turned into an unstoppable force of Christian knights and warriors, whose legacy is all around us to this day. Under the leadership of Duke William, the Normans expanded into the neighbouring provinces of northern France. But William's greatest achievement was the conquest of England in 1066. The Battle of Hastings marked the end of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and monarchy. The culture and politics of England would now be transformed by the Normans.

Presenters Una Stubbs and Richard Bacon take the artists to London's South Bank. In a converted Victorian warehouse by the Thames, expert judges Lachlan Goudie and Daphne Todd OBE set the nine remaining artists one of the most notoriously tricky painting challenges - portraiture.  For their opening task, the judges give the artists just four hours to paint an image they see every day in the bathroom mirror - their own self-portrait. But for many, success isn't staring them in the face as they struggle with proportion and scale.  In the quick-draw challenge the artists have just 30 minutes to capture the likeness of a complete stranger. And in their last chance to impress before someone is sent home, the judges want to see how the artists cope with two very well-known faces - EastEnders stars Rudolph Walker OBE, who plays Patrick Trueman, and actress Pam St. Clement, famous for her role as the formidable Pat Butcher for more than 25 years. For some it goes wrong from the off, and they're left gambling with the decision of starting again from scratch.  Also, Una chats with acclaimed royal portrait artist Nicky Phillips about what it's like to paint Her Majesty the Queen and to welcome both Prince William and Prince Harry into her home. And Lachlan gives his expert advice on how to sketch someone's likeness, where proportion and scale are everything.

Presenters Richard Bacon and Una Stubbs welcome the remaining eight amateur artists to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill.  The artists start in the Orangery, arranging a collection of personal items from home in a still life - from an oversized yellow hat to a beetroot and a skull - which they must capture on canvas in four hours using just acrylics. Will we see the first ever great painting to feature toast?  The quick draw challenge plays around with perspective and scale, and light and shadow, as the artists move outside to the lawn to sketch in chalks a giant chess board. But whilst the grounds for the judging are picturesque, expert judges Lachlan Goudie and Daphne Todd's comments are anything but pretty.  And in an imposing final challenge, the artists have to paint the facade of Blenheim Palace, attempting to effectively capture the drama of its stunning architecture. Una meets Emma Soames, granddaughter of Sir Winston Churchill, to talk about his lifelong love of Blenheim Palace and how it inspired some of his own amateur paintings.  With the challenge proving to unnerve some artists more than others, there's a shock decision by the judges about who goes home.

In the second of this three-part series, Professor Robert Bartlett explores the impact of the Norman conquest of Britain and Ireland. Bartlett shows how William the Conqueror imposed a new aristocracy, savagely cut down opposition and built scores of castles and cathedrals to intimidate and control. He also commissioned the Domesday Book, the greatest national survey of England that had ever been attempted.   England adapted to its new masters and both the language and culture were transformed as the Normans and the English intermarried. Bartlett shows how the political and cultural landscape of Scotland, Wales and Ireland were also forged by the Normans and argues that the Normans created the blueprint for colonialism in the modern world.

Richard Bacon and Una Stubbs are in Liverpool - as the remaining artists face three challenges that centre around this vibrant and diverse city. For their opening assignment the five remaining artists scour the city streets looking for inspiration from the historic docks to the music quarter as expert judges Lachlan Goudie and Daphne Todd OBE want them to paint their personal interpretation of the city in watercolours. Determined to impress the judges and get into the final, two artists make the bold decision to completely change their painting styles. For the quick draw, the artists climb onto the roof of Liverpool's Cunard Building to sketch in charcoal, pastel and pencil the commanding view of the neighbouring Royal Liver Building clock tower, which boasts the largest clock face in the UK. And despite having a clock in front of them, time gets the better of the artists as they try to capture its intricate architectural detail. Traditionally when artists painted cities they were attracted to grand imposing places such as London, Paris and Venice. So Una travels to Pendlebury in Manchester to discover what inspired LS Lowry, one of Britain's most recognised cityscape artists, to paint the textile mills and coal mines of the north of England. The closing task couples a busy cityscape with the challenge of painting moving water - as the artists paint the iconic Liverpool skyline from across the River Mersey. Clouds racing across the sky, reflections on the water and constantly changing sunlight test the artists' technical abilities to the limit as the judges eliminate one last artist before the final.

Professor Robert Bartlett explores the impact of the Normans on southern Europe and the Middle East, as they spread south in the 11th century.	Professor Robert Bartlett explores the impact of the Normans on southern Europe and the Middle East. The Normans spread south in the 11th century, winning control of southern Italy and the island of Sicily. There they created their most prosperous kingdom, where Christianity and Islam co-existed in relative harmony and mutual tolerance. It became a great centre of medieval culture and learning.   But events in the Middle East provoked the more aggressive side of the Norman character. In 1095, the Normans enthusiastically answered the pope's call for holy war against Islam and joined the first crusade. They lay siege to Jerusalem and eventually helped win back the holy city from the muslims. This bloody conquest left a deep rift between Christianity and Islam which is still being felt to this day.

During World War II, thousands of men and women from the Caribbean colonies volunteered to join the fight against Hitler. They tell their extraordinary stories in their own words.	This programme is based on a film entitled Divided By Race - United in War and Peace, produced by The-Latest.com.  During the Second World War, thousands of men and women from the Caribbean colonies volunteered to come to Britain to join the fight against Hitler. They risked their lives for king and empire, but their contribution has largely been forgotten.  Some of the last surviving Caribbean veterans tell their extraordinary wartime stories - from torpedo attacks by German U-boats and the RAF's blanket-bombing of Germany to the culture shock of Britain's freezing winters and war-torn landscapes. This brave sacrifice confronted the pioneers from the Caribbean with a lifelong challenge - to be treated as equals by the British government and the British people.  In testimony full of wit and charm, the veterans candidly reveal their experiences as some of the only black people in wartime Britain. They remember encounters with a curious British public and confrontation with the prejudices of white American GIs stationed in Britain.   After the war, many veterans returned to the Caribbean where they discovered jobs were scarce. Some came back to Britain to help rebuild its cities. They settled down with jobs and homes, got married and began to integrate their rich heritage into British culture. Now mostly in their 80s and 90s - the oldest is 104 - these pioneers from the Caribbean have helped transform Britain and created an enduring multicultural legacy.  With vivid first-hand testimony, observational documentary and rare archive footage, the programme gives a unique perspective on the Second World War and the history of 20th-century Britain.

6177829848736579884	Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners	01/08/2015	60	factual:factual/history	documentaries	Historian David Olusoga uncovers the untold stories of Britain's slave owners.	Documentary about the abolition of slavery. Huge sums of money were paid out in compensation, not to slaves, but to slave owners.	In 1834 Britain abolished slavery, a defining and celebrated moment in our national history. What has been largely forgotten is that abolition came at a price. The government of the day took the extraordinary step of compensating the slave owners for loss of their 'property', as Britain's slave owners were paid Â£17bn in today's money, whilst the slaves received nothing.  For nearly 200 years, the meticulous records that detail this story have lain in the archives virtually unexamined - until now. In an exclusive partnership with University College London, historian David Olusoga uncovers Britain's forgotten slave owners. Forensically examining the compensation records, he discovers the range of people who owned slaves and the scale of the slavery business.  What the records reveal is that the slave owners were not just the super-rich. They were widows, clergymen and shopkeepers - ordinary members of the middle-classes who exploited slave labour in distant lands. Yet many of them never looked a slave in the eye or experienced the brutal realities of plantation life.  In Barbados, David traces how Britain's slave economy emerged in the 17th century from just a few pioneering plantation owners. As David explores the systemic violence of slavery, in Jamaica he is introduced to some of the brutal tools used to terrorise the slaves and reads from the sadistic diaries of a notorious British slave owner. Elsewhere, on a visit to the spectacularly opulent Harewood House in Yorkshire, he glimpses how the slave owners' wealth seeped into every corner of Britain.  Finally, amongst the vast slave registers that record all 800,000 men, women and children in British hands at the point of abolition, David counts the tragic human cost of this chapter in our nation's history.

Documentary. David Olusoga traces the bitter propaganda war waged between the pro-slavery lobby and the abolitionists.	Historian David Olusoga continues his examination of Britain's forgotten slave owners. In this episode, David explores how in 1834 the government arrived at the extraordinary decision to compensate the slave owners with the equivalent of Â£17 billion in today's money. Tracing the bitter propaganda war waged between the pro-slavery lobby and the abolitionists, he reveals that paying off the slave owners for the loss of their human property was, ultimately, the only way to bring the system to an end.  Meticulously kept records held at the National Archives detail the names of the 46,000 slave owners from across the British empire who had a slice of this vast handout. Combined with new research, shared exclusively with the BBC by University College London, it reveals more about Britain's slave owners than we've ever known before.  Of the 46,000 names in the 1834 compensation records, 3,000 lived in Britain, yet they owned half of the slaves across the empire and pocketed half of the compensation money. These include members of the clergy and of the House of Lords. The records also show that at the point of abolition, more than 40 per cent of all the slave owners were women.  David goes on to investigate what happened to the wealth generated by the slave system and compensation pay out. He reveals aspects of Britain's spectacular industrialisation in the 19th century, the consolidation of the City of London as a world centre of finance, and a number of the country's most well-known institutions that all have links to slave-derived wealth.  Ultimately, David discovers that the country's debt to slavery is far greater than previously thought, shaping everything from the nation's property landscape to its ideas about race. A legacy that can still be felt today.

Professor Iain Stewart looks back at the 1950s, a time when the oil and gas fields of the Middle East became a focus for military conflict.	By the early 1950s, a holy trinity of oil, plastics and fertilisers had transformed the planet. But as Professor Iain Stewart reveals, when the oil-producing countries demanded a greater share in profits from the western energy companies, the oil and gas fields of the Middle East became a focus for coup d'etats and military conflict.  In the North Sea, Prof Stewart recalls the race against time to find alternative supplies in the shallow, but turbulent waters both here and in America's Gulf coast.  The offshore discoveries in the 1970s proved to be a game changer. It marked an engineering revolution, the moment when 'difficult' oil and gas (previously unviable sources) could be commercially produced from the ocean depths. It was the moment when Western Europe and the US finally unshackled themselves from their 20th-century energy security nightmare.

Professor Iain Stewart examines the situation in the 21st century, at which point the global consumption of oil, coal and gas is at an all-time high.	As we entered the 21st century, the world was guzzling oil, coal and gas like never before. Despite fears of 'peak oil', Professor Iain Stewart discovers that while huge technological advances are helping extend the life of existing oilfields, new unconventional oil and gas supplies like shale gas and tar sands are extending the hydrocarbon age well into the 21st century.  Given there's plenty of fossil fuels still in the ground, the spectre of climate change has forced many to ask can we really afford to burn what's left? In this concluding episode, Iain Stewart argues we face a stark choice.  Do we continue feed our addiction - suck Planet Oil dry - and risk catastrophic climate change, or do we go hell for leather for alternative energy sources, such as nuclear and renewables, to make the transition from our fossil fuel past to a low-carbon future. In which case, how do we make that shift?

Dr Kevin Fong learns how we can survive in hostile conditions. In the second programme he goes goes climbing in the Alps to find out how the body responds to altitude.	We think of ourselves as a global species, but in fact we can only comfortably survive on less than a quarter of the earth's surface.   In To Boldly Go, doctor of extreme medicine Kevin Fong sets out to discover how we are able to conquer the other 75 per cent. In an eye-popping series of experiments, Dr Fong uses his own body to demonstrate how unsuited our biology is to much of the planet - and how we have had to develop the technology to let us survive there.  In the second programme of the series, Dr Fong finds out how the body responds to altitude. The short answer to that question is: badly - as Dr Fong finds out, climbing one of the tallest mountains in the Alps, and subjecting himself to a sudden depressurisation to 25,000 feet. But although we struggle to deal with altitude, the defining story of 20th-century technology was our quest to leave the surface of the earth behind and travel up through the atmosphere and into space.  The natural home of our species is at sea level. Even today more than three-quarters of the world's population live at altitudes below 500m. And there is a very good reason for that - the higher we go, the less oxygen there is in the air and the harder we find it to survive.

Prof Alice Roberts tests the claim that some people feel less bloated and more alert when they cut out gluten. 30 volunteers embark on a gluten-free diet to see if they feel healthier. But there's a twist. One half will be adding gluten to their diet and the other will be gluten free - but they won't know which is which. We find out whether going gluten free delivers health benefits or is just a fad.  Tom Kerridge has been a professional chef for over 20 years and in that time he has learned many tips and tricks to deliver food that consistently tastes great. He's keen to share these trade secrets so we can all improve our cooking. This time, he reveals how a garnish can transform an everyday dish into something special.  Forget coupons - when it comes saving money on your shop, online cashback apps are taking over. Our consumer journalist Sean Fletcher reveals how one savvy shopper saves around Â£1,500 a year by using these apps. She can do this while still buying the brands she likes and the food she needs. So we asked our bargain hunter to do a mid-week shop to see how much she could save. Find out how she slashed her supermarket bill in half simply by using these new cashback apps.

During one term at the University of Central Florida, the BBC's award-winning This World programme follows the life of a group of frat boys as they embark on the pledging process, when new recruits have to prove themselves before they can become a fraternity brother.

For hundreds of families, Great Ormond Street Hospital has become a second home. For parents that means being by their child's bedside around the clock, and for children, it results in a constant treadmill of appointments and treatments.  When Rosie was just two years old, her heart began to fail. Great Ormond Street Hospital doctors diagnosed her with restrictive cardiomyopathy, an extremely rare condition affecting just one in a million children, where the heart is too weak to pump blood. Rosie has had an operation to fit a mechanical heart while she awaits a donor, and so she needs intensive around-the-clock care with her mother consistently by her side.  Maisy has epidermolysis bullosa, known as butterfly syndrome, which is an agonising skin disorder where the body lacks the protein it needs to hold the layers of skin together, making it blistered and as fragile as a butterfly's wing. It is such a rare and serious condition that Great Ormond Street Hospital specialists have been looking after her since birth.  Despite the brilliant world-class care, there is nowhere private outside for the families to escape from the constant noise, bustle and bright lights of this huge hospital. The DIY SOS team and Chris Beardshaw have taken on this hugely ambitious build, with tricky logistics and emotional volunteers, in order to offer the many brave families a bespoke and lush calming rooftop garden as a space of welcome respite.

Documentary which tells the story of how, in the years following the Second World War, countries competed to launch the most magnificent passenger ships on the great ocean routes.   National pride and prestige were at stake. The Americans had the United States, the fastest liner of all; the Dutch had the elegant Rotterdam; the Italians had the sleek Michelangelo; the French had the France as their supreme symbol of national culture and cuisine; and Britain had the Queens Mary and Elizabeth.   The coming of the jetliner and the 1960s' assault on class and privilege might have swept this world away, but as the film explains, the giant vessels sailed on. Today, more people than ever travel on big ships - liners that have a modern take on glamour and romance.

Historian Dan Snow explores the life of his forebear David Lloyd George, the British prime minister at the end of the First World War, when he was hailed as a national hero.	At the end of the First World War, Britain's prime minister David Lloyd George was a national hero, hailed as 'the man who won the war'. A hundred years after he became PM, Lloyd George's great-great-grandson Dan Snow explores his famous forebear's life and asks why he's not better remembered, why he's not as famous a wartime leader as his friend and protege Winston Churchill. It's a tale of sex and scandal, success and failure, with Dan discovering some home truths from his family's history.  Dan's journey starts in north Wales in the village of Llanystumdwy, where Lloyd George was raised by his uncle after his father's death. It's an area Dan knows well from childhood holidays visiting his grandmother. He climbs Moel y Gest, a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea, a view virtually unchanged since Lloyd George's day. Taking the Ffestiniog railway up into the mountains Dan travels in Lloyd George's own railway carriage, reputedly a place when he would enjoy some private time with his secretary.  Like Lloyd George, Dan journeys from Wales to Parliament, filming in the House of Commons where his ancestor made such an impact. Initially Lloyd George was a radical Liberal, causing outrage by opposing the Boer War in 1899, but ten years later he was chancellor of the exchequer, introducing some of the most important legislation of the early 20th century. His budget of 1909 brought in national insurance and old age pensions and, as his biographer Roy Hattersley tells Dan, laid the foundations of the welfare state.  When Britain went to war in August 1914, Lloyd George was a pivotal member of the cabinet. Historian Margaret Macmillan, an expert on the First World War and another descendant of Lloyd George, points out that if he'd come out against the war the Liberal government would have fallen. Once war was declared Lloyd George was important in recruiting the new citizen's army, making speeches across the country. But in private he was making sure his sons didn't volunteer straightaway, another example of Lloyd George's double dealing.  Lloyd George's private life is as famous as his politics. Before the war he had a string of affairs, but by 1914 he was involved with his secretary Frances Stevenson. Half his age, she was a pioneering female civil servant and a constant companion during the First World War. Meeting her biographer John Campbell, Dan discovers some shocking secrets about their relationship during the war years.  Lloyd George's most significant work in the early years of the war was in munitions production. Britain, like all the other warring countries, was running out of shells. He revolutionised the war economy, creating a huge workforce, including many women, to produce the vast numbers of guns and ammunition needed to wage total war. Dan visits an engineering works in north Wales which in 1917 was turned over to armaments production.  But Lloyd George's dynamism wasn't reflected in the rest of the government, especially the prime minister Herbert Asquith. At the end of 1916 after the failure of the Somme, matters came to a head and Asquith was forced to resign to be replaced by Lloyd George. He was the first man from such humble origins to become prime minister.  In spring 1918, the Germans broke through and almost reached Paris, but the Allies fought back. This is when Lloyd George's war machine came into the effect - the huge amount of munitions he helped create, along with the newly arrived American troops, forced the German army into retreat, finally signing the Armistice on 11 November 1918.  In 1918, Lloyd George was wildly popular and re-elected by a landslide, but his postwar career was less successful. Dan visits the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles where Lloyd George signed the famous treaty, but many think that this fuelled German resentment and led to the Second World War 20 years later. At home, the 'land fit for heroes' which Lloyd George had promised didn't materialise and there was a postwar slump. When it was revealed that he'd sold honours to fund his Liberal Party his days were numbered, and he was finally ousted by his Conservative coalition partners in 1922.  Until his death in 1945 Lloyd George was a figure in the wilderness, never returned to power and further damaging his reputation with an ill-advised visit to Hitler in 1936. He was, as Dan concludes, a flawed hero, but one from whom he's proud to be descended.

The extraordinary story of a strange cult, which came to light in 2013 when news broke about three women emerging from a small flat in south London after decades in captivity.	This documentary by acclaimed director Vanessa Engle tells the extraordinary story of a strange cult, which came to light in 2013 when a sensational news story broke about three women emerging from a small flat in Brixton in south London after decades in captivity. Tracing the group back to its roots in the 1970s, the film describes how its leader Aravindan Balakrishnan, a student of Indian origin, believed in an international communist revolution and created a tiny political sect that followed the teachings of China's Chairman Mao.  The film features exclusive interviews with two of the women who escaped - Aisha Wahab, a 72-year-old Malaysian woman who was part of Balakrishnan's group for 40 years, and Katy Morgan-Davies, Balakrishnan's daughter, who was born and raised in captivity. The film documents how this left-wing collective evolved into a bizarre pseudo-religious cult, where members were controlled, threatened and brainwashed so that they were too terrified to leave.

Dr Helen Czerski investigates the science behind the sounds we're familiar with and the sounds that we normally can't hear, from Big Ben to the Stromboli volcano.	Dr Helen Czerski investigates the extraordinary science behind the sounds we're familiar with and the sounds that we normally can't hear.  She begins by exploring the simplest of ideas: what is a sound? At the Palace of Westminster, Helen teams up with scientists from the University of Leicester to carry out state-of-the-art measurements using lasers to reveal how the most famous bell in the world - Big Ben - vibrates to create pressure waves in the air at particular frequencies. This is how Big Ben produces its distinct sound. It's the first time that these laser measurements have been done on Big Ben.  With soprano singer Lesley Garrett CBE, Helen explores the science of the singing voice - revealing in intimate detail its inner workings and how it produces sound. Lesley undergoes a laryngoscopy to show the vocal folds of her larynx. At University College London, Lesley sings I Dreamed a Dream inside an MRI scanner to reveal how her vocal tract acts as a 'resonator', amplifying and shaping the sound from her larynx.  Having explored the world of sounds with which we are familiar, Helen discovers the hidden world of sounds that lie beyond the range of human hearing. At the summit of Stromboli, one of Europe's most active volcanoes, Helen and volcanologist Dr Jeffrey Johnson use a special microphone to record the extraordinary deep tone produced by the volcano as it explodes - a frequency far too low for the human ear to detect. Helen reveals how the volcano produces sound in a similar way to a musical instrument - with the volcano vent acting as a 'sound resonator'.  Finally, at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, Helen meets a scientist who has discovered evidence of sound waves in space, created by a giant black hole. These sounds are one million billion times lower than the limit of human hearing and could be the key in figuring out how galaxy clusters, the largest structures in the universe, grow.

Documentary about the history and tradition of the British Christmas dinner and the role it still plays in a Britain of different faiths, food fads and health concerns.	It's the season of peace and goodwill to all, when we think of those less fortunate than ourselves. It's also the time of year when we stuff our faces and gorge and drink ourselves silly.

What does it say about us as a nation? Can it survive in a rapidly changing and culturally diverse Britain of different faiths, food fads and health concerns?   For many, Christmas dinner means the anxiety and pressure to get it right, the endless advice from every celebrity chef reinventing the wheel and the bizarre traditions that must be maintained at all costs. For others it's a time to savour good food, dine with family and friends and connect with ancient customs and rituals. Either way, we end up completely stuffed.

Andrew Martin takes three railway journeys following the routes of three of the most famous named trains - the Flying Scotsman, the Cornish Riviera Express and the Brighton Belle.	Timeshift journeys back to a lost era of rail travel, when trains had names, character and style. Once the pride of the railway companies that ran them, the named train is now largely consigned to railway history.

He embarks on three railway journeys around Britain, following the routes of three of the most famous named trains - the Flying Scotsman, the Cornish Riviera Express and the Brighton Belle. We reflect on travel during the golden age of railways - when the journey itself was as important as reaching your destination - and compare those same journeys with the passenger experience today.

6854711111145496193	Empire of the Tsars: Romanov Russia with Lucy Worsley	29/07/2020	60	factual/history	documentaries	Lucy examines the reign of Catherine the Great and the conflict with Napoleonic France.	The story of the dynasty that ruled Russia for more than three centuries. Lucy examines the reign of Catherine the Great and the conflict with Napoleonic France.	Lucy Worsley continues her journey through Russia in the footsteps of the Romanovs, the most powerful royal dynasty in modern European history.   In this episode she examines the extraordinary reign of Catherine the Great, and the traumatic conflict with Napoleonic France that provides the setting for the novel War and Peace.  Lucy begins in the 18th century, when the great palaces of the Romanovs were built. But in Romanov Russia, blood was always intermingled with the gold - these splendid interiors were the backdrop to affairs, coups and murder.  At the magnificent palace of Peterhof near St Petersburg, Lucy charts the meteoric rise of Catherine the Great, who seized the Russian throne from her husband Peter III in 1762 and became the most powerful woman in the world. Catherine was a woman of huge passions - for art, for her adopted country (she was German by birth) and for her many lovers.   Lucy visits the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, once the home of Catherine's vast art collection. Here she explores how, once Catherine had taken the throne, she compensated for her foreign origins by taking careful control of her image, using her portraits and clothes to create a brand that looked authentically Russian yet also modern and sophisticated. Lucy tells how Catherine expanded her empire through military victories overseas, while at home she encouraged education and introduced smallpox inoculation to Russia. But Catherine struggled to introduce deeper reforms, and the institution of serfdom remained largely unchanged. Lucy explains how this injustice fuelled a violent rebellion.   Nevertheless, Catherine left Russia more powerful on the world stage than ever. But all she had achieved looked set to be undone when Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812. Lucy relives the pivotal battle of Borodino, when the Russian army finally confronted the French forces; the traumatic destruction of Moscow; and, under Catherine's grandson Alexander, the eventual victory over the French that provided the Romanov dynasty with its most glorious hour.

Lucy investigates how the Romanov family's grip on Russia unravelled in their final century, with the years 1825-1918 being bloody and traumatic.	Lucy Worsley concludes her history of the Romanov dynasty, investigating how the family's grip on Russia unravelled in their final century. She shows how the years 1825-1918 were bloody and traumatic, a period when four tsars tried - and failed - to deal with the growing pressure for constitutional reform and revolution.  Lucy finds out how the Romanovs tried to change the system themselves - in 1861, millions of enslaved serfs were freed by the Tsar-Liberator, Alexander II. But Alexander paid the ultimate penalty for opening the Pandora's box of reform when he was later blown up by terrorists on the streets of St Petersburg.   Elsewhere, there was repression, denial, war and - in the case of the last tsar, Nicholas II - a fatalistic belief in the power of God, with Nicholas's faith in the notorious holy man Rasputin being a major part in his undoing. Lucy also details the chilling murder of Nicholas and his family in 1918, and asks whether all of this horror have been avoided.  Lucy also shows how there was a growing movement among the people of Russia to determine their own fate. She traces the growth of the intelligentsia, writers and thinkers who sought to have a voice about Russia. Speaking out came with a risk - after Ivan Turgenev wrote about the appalling life of the serfs in 1852, he was sentenced to house arrest by tsar Nicholas I. Lucy also shows how anger against the Romanov regime created a later generation of radicals committed to overturning the status quo. Some would turn to terrorism and, finally, revolution.  As well as political upheaval there is private drama, and Lucy explains how Nicholas II's family life played into his family's downfall. His son and heir Alexei suffered from haemophilia - the secrecy the family placed around the condition led them into seclusion, further distancing them from the Russian people. It also led them to the influence of man who seemed to have the power to heal their son, and who was seen as a malign influence on Nicholas - Rasputin.
